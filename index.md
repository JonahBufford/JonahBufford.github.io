#### Research Question

What percentage of energy consumed by my home electric kettle is directly converted to thermal energy in the water? Does this change as the mass of water used increases?

#### Data

This table shows the raw measurements taken during the tests. Temperature was taken with a Farenheit thermometer and converted to Celsius. Initial temperature was taken right before heating, with the water in the kettle, and final temperature was taken right after heating. The time was calculated from the heating process being started until the kettle clicked off.

| Test | Water Mass | Initial Temperature | Final Temperature | Increase in Temperature | Heating Time |
|------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| 1    | 240 g      | 25.6 Celsius        | 93.9 Celsius      | 68.3 Celsius            | 79 Seconds   |
| 2    | 240 g      | 28.9 Celsius        | 91.1 Celsius      | 82.2 Celsius            | 75 Seconds   |
| 3    | 420 g      | 15.6 Celsius        | 95.6 Celsius      | 80.0 Celsius            | 138 Seconds  |
| 4    | 420 g      | 20.0 Celsius        | 93.9 Celsius      | 73.9 Celsius            | 130 Seconds  |
| 5    | 600 g      | 21.7 Celsius        | 94.4 Celsius      | 72.7 Celsius            | 168 Seconds  |
| 6    | 600 g      | 17.8 Celsius        | 93.3 Celsius      | 75.5 Celsius            | 180 Seconds  |                 
| 7    | 720 g      | 16.7 Celsius        | 93.3 Celsius      | 76.6 Celsius            | 218 Seconds  |
| 8    | 720 g      | 15.6 Celsius        | 93.3 Celsius      | 77.7 Celsius            | 213 Seconds  |
| 9    | 960 g      | 28.9 Celsius        | 94.4 Celsius      | 65.5 Celsius            | 226 Seconds  |
| 10   | 960 g      | 15.6 Celsius        | 93.9 Celsius      | 78.3 Celsius            | 280 Seconds  |
| 11   | 1080 g     | 14.4 Celsius        | 95.6 Celsius      | 81.2 Celsius            | 318 Seconds  |
| 12   | 1080 g     | 21.1 Celsius        | 95.0 Celsius      | 73.9 Celsius            | 296 Seconds  |
